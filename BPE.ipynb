    "\n",
    "Our n-gram models are currently what we call *word-level* models: models that have their atomic units as words in a vocabulary. While we like to spell-out our word tokens in our representations, our model treats different words in the vocabulary as unrelated, unstructured units --- elements in the set $V$. In fact, our language models would work just as well if every element in our vocabulary was replaced by a unique integer. In fact, this is often done in practice! Partially to compress our representations (now you just need an array rather than a dictionary, because your keys are now indicies!), and partially because this will become computationally convenient to us when we move into neural network techniques later in the course!\n",
    "\n",
    "To get comfortable doing that, I'll ask you to warm-up by constructing a \"word2idx\" dictionary that maps a word to it's index in the vocabulary with a function `get_word2idx` (which, for now, will be a nice small example vocab!), as well as an `ngram2idxs` function that turns your n-gram tuples into integer tuples!\n",

Like our words, to emphasize that there is nothing about the characters themselves (other than their identity) that our models can consider, we will subsititute an integer for the character itself. Since we're working with characters, there are standard integer encodings for characters (in Python 3, [Unicode](https://home.unicode.org/)). the `ord` function maps characters to their unicode values.\n",

Of course, since a string itself is a sequence of characters (in Python, just strings of length 1) this doesn't actually take up much space. However, this simplicity makes it a good place to introduce python [generators](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-generator), a special kind of function that allows you to create something iterable (comparable to returning a list you want to for-loop through) but without having to take up the memory required to store every element of that list at the same time. You do this by *generating* the next value as you need it.

The next cell prompts you to install it, and afterward you may need to restart your kernel to import transformers.\n",
